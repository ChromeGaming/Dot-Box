					<strong>Scoring: 🏆</strong><br />
					- Each completed box is worth one point.<br />
					- The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the
					winner.<br />
					- In case of a tie, the player who completed the last box wins.<br />
					- Optionally, a tie can be broken by the number of consecutive boxes
					completed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Strategies: 🧠</strong><br />
					- Try to force your opponent into a position where they have to give
					you a box.<br />
					- Plan your moves ahead and avoid creating a situation where your
					opponent can complete a box unless you can complete the fourth
					side.<br />
					- Control the board by capturing multiple boxes in one turn by
					carefully planning your moves.<br />
					- Take advantage of the extra turn you get after completing a box to
					create more opportunities for yourself.<br />
					- Look for opportunities to create chains and loops of boxes that
					can be captured in one turn.<br />
					- Be mindful of your opponent's potential moves and try to block
					them from completing boxes whenever possible.
