## üéÆ Gaming Rule

The game is very simple and easy to play, it's a multiplayer game where each player gets one chance to play alternatively. The goal is to maximize the number of boxes owned. The game continues until no box is left unoccupied. 

### How to Play
1. **Setup:** At the start of the game, choose the number of squares you want to have by specifying the number of rows and columns. The range is from 5 to 30 for both rows and columns. Also, specify the number of players, which can be from 2 to 6.

2. **Gameplay:** 
   - Players take turns marking one side of a square on the board.
   - If a side completes a square along with previous marks, the player gets the box and an extra chance to play.
   - The game requires strategic thinking to maximize the number of boxes owned.

3. **Winning:** The player with the most boxes owned at the end of the game wins.
