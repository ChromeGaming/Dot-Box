   - **Mid to Late Game:** Prioritize closing boxes to prevent opponents from claiming territory.

### 2. **Box Closure** 📦
   - **Immediate Closure:** Always close a box if possible, unless it would immediately grant your opponent an advantage.
   - **Forcing Closure:** Try to force your opponent into closing a box that would benefit you more than them.

### 3. **Defensive Play** 🛡️
   - **Blocking Moves:** Use blocking moves to prevent your opponent from closing boxes or claiming territory.
   - **Strategic Sacrifice:** Sacrifice a box to prevent your opponent from getting a bigger advantage.

### 4. **Offensive Play** ⚔️
   - **Box Stealing:** Aim to steal boxes from your opponent by closing boxes that they are about to complete.
   - **Forcing Mistakes:** Force your opponent into making mistakes by creating complex board states.

### 5. **Control the Center** 🎯

   - **Access Points:** Keep control of the access points to the center to limit your opponent's options.

### 6. **Predictive Play** 🔮
   - **Anticipating Moves:** Try to anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your strategy accordingly.
   - **Stay Flexible:** Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on your opponent's actions.

### 7. **Endgame Strategies** 🏁

   - **Protecting Lead:** If you're ahead, focus on protecting your lead rather than taking risks.

### 8. **Mind Games** 🧠
