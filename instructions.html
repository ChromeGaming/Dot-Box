            <li>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
                - Players take turns to draw a line between two adjacent dots.<br>
                - A player who completes the fourth side of a box gets to claim that box and gets another turn.<br>
                - The game continues until all the boxes are completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scoring:</strong><br>
                - Each completed box is worth one point.<br>
                - The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategies:</strong><br>
                - Try to force your opponent into a position where they have to give you a box.<br>
                - Plan your moves ahead and avoid creating a situation where your opponent can complete a box unless you can complete the fourth side.
